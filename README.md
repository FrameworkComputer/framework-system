# Framework System

Rust libraries and tools to interact with the system.

The tool works on Linux, Windows and the UEFI shell.
Download it from the latest [GH Actions](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/framework-system/actions?query=branch%3Amain) run on the main branch.
Most features are supported on every "OS". See below for details.

## Prerequisites

Only [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is needed. Based on `rust-toolchain.toml` it
will install the right toolchain and version for this project.

## Building

MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version):

- 1.61 for Linux/Windows
- 1.68 for UEFI

```sh
# Running linter
cargo clippy

# Running autoformatter as a check
cargo fmt --check

# Fixing format issues
cargo fmt

# Building the library and tool
cargo build

# Building only the library
cargo build -p framework_lib

# Building only the tool
cargo build -p framework_tool
ls -l target/debug/framework_tool

# Build the UEFI application
# Can't be built with cargo! That's why we need to exclude it in the other commands.
make -C framework_uefi
ls -l framework_uefi/build/x86_64-unknown-uefi/boot.efi
```

Building on Windows or in general with fewer features:

```ps1
# Because we're fetching a private dependency from git, it might be necessary
# to force cargo to use the git commandline. In powershell run:
$env:CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI='true'

# Build the library and tool
cargo build --no-default-features --features "windows"

# Running the tool
cargo run --no-default-features --features "windows"
```

Cross compile from Linux to FreeBSD:

```sh
# One time, install cross tool
cargo install cross

# Make sure docker is started as well
sudo systemctl start docker

# Build
cross build --target=x86_64-unknown-freebsd --no-default-features --features unix
```

## Running

Run without any arguments to see the help:

```
> cargo run

###### Running on Windows
Windows does not ship with a Chrome EC driver. However there is an open-source implementation that this tool can take advantage of.
The project is hosted on GitHub and you can download pre-built binaries
[there](https://github.com/DHowett/FrameworkWindowsUtils/releases).

The driver is not signed by Microsoft, so you will have to enable testsigning.

##### Running on ChromeOS

The application can run on ChromeOS but most commands rely on custom host
commands that we built into the EC firmware of non-Chromebook Framework laptops.
In theory you could add those patches to the Chromebook platform, build your
own EC firmware and flash it.

## Tests

- [x] Basic unit tests
- [x] Test parsing real binaries

## Version Check

Check if the firmware version is what you expect, returns exit code 0 on
succcess, 1 on failure.

```
# Check which devices it's available for
> ./framework_system --device
  [possible values: bios, ec, pd0, pd1, rtm01, rtm23]

For more information try '--help'

# Successful compare
> ./framework_system --device bios --compare-version 03.01
Target Version "03.01"
Comparing BIOS version "03.01"
Compared version:   0
> echo $?
0

# Failed compare
> ./framework_system --device bios --compare-version 03.00
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
Target Version "03.00"
Comparing BIOS version "03.01"
Compared version:   1
Error: "Fail"

> echo $?
1
```

## Debugging

To debug, increase the verbosity from the commandline with `-v`.
The verbosity levels are:

| Commandline | Level  |
|-------------|--------|
| `-q`        | No log |
| None        | Error  |
| `-v`        | Warn   |
| `-vv`       | Info   |
| `-vvv`      | Debug  |
| `-vvvv`     | Trace  |

For example it is useful to check which EC driver is used:

```
> framework_tool --kblight -vvv
[DEBUG] Chromium EC Driver: CrosEc
[DEBUG] send_command(command=0x22, ver=0, data_len=0)
Keyboard backlight: 0%

> framework_tool --driver portio --kblight -vvv
[DEBUG] Chromium EC Driver: Portio
[DEBUG] send_command(command=0x22, ver=0, data_len=0)
Keyboard backlight: 0%
```

## FreeBSD

```
sudo pkg install hidapi

# Build the library and tool
cargo build --no-default-features --features freebsd

# Running the tool
cargo run --no-default-features --features freebsd
```
